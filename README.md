# Code and data for Eriksen and Etzerodt (2018): Time-Series Cross-Section Analysis for Komparativ Politisk Ã˜konomi 

This page contains the replication code and data for Eriksen and Etzerodt (2018). 

The project consists of the following code that must be run in the indicated order: 
 - Settings.R
 - Libraries.R
 - Data_final.R
 - Desc_final.R
 - Sim_Non_Stat_Estimation.R
 - Sim_Unit_root.R
 - Sim_ADL_FDL.R
 - Example_Fixed_Effects.R
 - Reg_BoxJenkins_Example.R
 - Unit_root_test.do

The project code is written in R with the exception of the file `Unit_root_test.do`. All R code can be run in the correct order from the master file `Main.R`. The `Unit_root_test.do` file must be run separately after the previous code has run. To ensure that the `Main.R` master file can locate the data and other code files, it is possible to run the code from the included RProject "EE_2018.RProject".
