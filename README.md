# Code and data for Eriksen and Etserodt (2018)

 This page contains the code and data for the paper by Eriksen and Etzerodt (2018). 
 
 To run the code, start with opening the RProject file "EE_2018.RProject". This will set the working directory for your computer. Then, run the R file "Main.R". The file loads the data into R, and then runs the code for the paper by parts. 
 
 A single Stata .do file contains code for running IPS unit root tests.
